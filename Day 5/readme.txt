Problem of the day: Leftmost and rightmost nodes of binary tree
Link to Question: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/leftmost-and-rightmost-nodes-of-binary-tree/1

Given a Binary Tree of size N, Print the corner nodes ie- the node at the leftmost and rightmost of each level.

Example 1:

Input :
         1
       /  \
     2      3
    / \    / \
   4   5  6   7    
Output: 1 2 3 4 7
Explanation:
Corners at level 0: 1
Corners at level 1: 2 3
Corners at level 2: 4 7

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(number of nodes in a level)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5


Test Cases Passed: 
1160 /1160
