Question link: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/print-first-n-fibonacci-numbers1002/1

Question: Given a number N, find the first N Fibonacci numbers. The first two number of the series are 1 and 1.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
Output: 1 1 2 3 5
Example 2:

Input:
N = 7
Output: 1 1 2 3 5 8 13

Expected Time Complexity: O(N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).
Note: This space is used to store and return the answer for printing purpose.

Constraints:
1<= N <=84
