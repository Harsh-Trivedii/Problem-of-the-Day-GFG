Problem of the day: Partition Equal Subset Sum

Question link: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/subset-sum-problem2014/1

Question: Given an array arr[] of size N, check if it can be partitioned into two parts such that the sum of elements in both parts is the same.

Example 1:

Input: N = 4
arr = {1, 5, 11, 5}
Output: YES
Explanation: 
The two parts are {1, 5, 5} and {11}.
Example 2:

Input: N = 3
arr = {1, 3, 5}
Output: NO
Explanation: This array can never be 
partitioned into two such parts.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N*sum of elements)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N*sum of elements)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1000
N*sum of elements ≤ 5*106
