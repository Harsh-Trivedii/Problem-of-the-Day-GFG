Problem of the day: Binary Tree to BST

Question link: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/binary-tree-to-bst/1

Question: Given a Binary Tree, convert it to Binary Search Tree in such a way that keeps the original structure of Binary Tree intact.
 Example 1:

Input:
      1
    /   \
   2     3
Output: 
1 2 3
Explanation:
The converted BST will be 
      2
    /   \
   1     3


Expected Time Complexity: O(NLogN).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

Constraints:
1 <= Number of nodes <= 105
