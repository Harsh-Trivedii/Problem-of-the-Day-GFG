Problem of the day: Mother Vertex

Question link: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/mother-vertex/1

Question: Given a Directed Graph, find a Mother Vertex in the Graph (if present). 
A Mother Vertex is a vertex through which we can reach all the other vertices of the Graph.

Example 1:

Input: 

Output: 0
Explanation: According to the given edges, all 
nodes can be reaced from nodes from 0, 1 and 2. 
But, since 0 is minimum among 0,1 and 2, so 0 
is the output.

Expected Time Complexity: O(V + E)
Expected Space Compelxity: O(V)

Constraints:
1 ≤ V ≤ 500
